# Lightspeed API Python Client
> Developed by Node Development

The Lightspeed API Python Client is a wrapper developed to interface with the REST API provided by the Lightspeed platform. It greatly helps to develop applications using Python code instead of PHP (using the official library) or calling numerous url's using cURL. To get a complete view of all available calls visit their [API documentation page](https://developers.lightspeedhq.com/ecom/introduction/introduction/).

## Getting started

### Authentication and API key
In order to use this library one must first obtain an API key and API secret from lightspeed. Contact the [Customer Service](https://ecom-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000593913-Contact-us) department of Lightspeed. API keys and secrets can only be supplied to shop owners. To read more about authentication read the [official documentation](https://developers.lightspeedhq.com/ecom/introduction/authentication/).

Keep the API key and secret safe. If it ends up in malicous hands they will be able to abuse it. The API key and secret will be used to create an API client object in this library.

### Requirements
This package requires atleast Python 3.5 to work. It will install the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) package in addition.

### Installing
Use the package manager pip to install this package.
```
pip install https://nodedevelopment.net/python-packages/lightspeed-api-client/lightspeed_api_client_dmizrahi-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
